# Superspalter
## Overview:
Superspalter is a multi-two-dimensional role-playing, action-adventure puzzle game that uses a switching-perspective mechanism to get the player through different levels, similar to Nintendo’s Paper Mario series. The etymology of Superspalter consists of the shortened concatenation of the phrase “Super Perspective Alteration.” The game has 2 dimensions, which I refer to as the platformer and aerial view from here on out. The game behaves like a typical 2D platformer, where players can jump over obstacles and chasms and collect items along the xy-axis. However, one will soon notice that some obstacles seem impossible to conquer until we switch the perspective to a top-down, aerial view. This introduces a third dimension that wasn’t available in the platformer, but we have reduced a dimension (the y-axis), leaving us with the xz-axis. Players in the aerial view can now move left and right, but they can no longer jump (due to a lack in the y-axis). There also exist obstacles that we may encounter in aerial view that cannot be conquered until we switch perspectives back to platformer view. We guide the character through four levels which increase in difficulty. 
## Story integration (if I have time):
In the world of Superspalter, reality is fractured. Two distinct dimensions, known as the Platformer Realm and the Aerial Realm, exist side by side but never intersect—until now. You play as Alto, an ordinary adventurer with extraordinary abilities, who discovers an ancient artifact known as the Spalter Stone, which grants the power to shift between these dimensions. This stone allows you to unlock hidden paths, bypass impossible obstacles, and manipulate space itself.
Guided by an unknown force, you will embark on a quest to restore balance between the two realms. However, the journey won't be easy—each realm presents unique challenges that can only be overcome by mastering the art of perspective alteration. As you progress through the four increasingly difficult levels, you must solve puzzles and collect fragments of the fractured realms to restore the world to its former unity.
But beware, for not everything is as it seems. There are forces that seek to keep the realms divided, and you will have to navigate both worlds' dangers to discover the truth behind the fracture. Will you be brave enough to shift through dimensions and see reality from a new perspective?
## Controls:
Jumping and Movement (Platformer View): The player can move forward and backward (along the x-axis) with left-right movement mapped to the ‘A’ and ‘D’ keys. The player can also jump (along the y-axis) with the ‘SPACE’ or ‘W’ key. The player can perform a dash with the ‘Shift’ key
Switching Perspectives: The player switches between the platformer and aerial views, using the ‘TAB’ key.
Movement in Aerial View: The player’s character can move forward, backward, and left-and-rightward (along the xz-axis) with the ‘W’, ‘A’, ‘S’, and ‘D’ keys. However, jumping is restricted.
Interaction: The player can interact with specific objects and progress through the storyline in the game by pressing the ‘E’ key.
## Art Assets:
Player: For the platformer view character art, I’ll be using free open-source sprites found on the Unity Asset Store. The character will likely be in the form of pixel art, and it will have moving and jumping animations (idle animations if I have time). For the aerial view, the player will be shown in a bird’s-eye, top-down view. The character design will not be horizontally symmetrical to let players know what direction they’re facing.
Background, platforms, objects, and obstacles: This will likely be from the free section in the Unity Asset Store, also in pixelated form. The collectable fragment art can be created by me in the same pixelated aesthetic as the rest of the game if nothing is suitable for my needs from the asset store. Some common obstacles in the game include boxes and spikes.
## Audio Assets:
Player movement: Walking, dashing, jumping, landing, falling, death. I want the player’s footsteps to sound different between worlds, so I’ll alter the aerial perspective’s movement sound effects by reversing or raising its pitch.
Interactions: Collecting shards, progression through storyline, completing a level.
Background music: A friend mentioned they made audio samples for a video game that never got implemented, so I might ask him if I could use them (given that it matches the aesthetic of Superspalter), as well as give him credit.
## Concerns:
Switching between the platformer and aerial realm will be a challenging task. Actually changing the angle of the current gameplay will make this game a three-dimensional game (which isn’t for this project). So instead, I’ll have two parallel views, the XY and the XZ windows, and just switch between these. Keeping character progression between these two viewpoints will be challenging, especially when one of them has a dimension that the other one doesn’t have. I’ll track the x-axis movement to make it easier. I might limit when and where the player can switch so that there aren’t any situations that don’t make sense in the gameplay.
